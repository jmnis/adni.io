Madonna: Frozen
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart′s not open
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key
Underworld: Born slippy

CharliXCX: Art Bitch
You are an art bitch at heart
But it's wonderful, so beautiful, so amazingly lovely
And I love the way you hate love
It's so refreshingly nice to see it in your eyes
That you mean exactly what you say

Sugababes: Stronger
See I'm gonna do this for me–e-e-e-e-e
I'm all alone and finally,
I'm getting stronger
You've come to see
Just what I can be
I'm getting stronger

ABBA
Gimme gimme gimme (A Man after Midnight)
Won’t somebody help me take the shadows away
Beyonce: all the single ladies
The presets: This Boy’s in Love
This boy's in loooooooooove
This boy's in love
(Under city, under city lights)

Freddy Mercury: Love Kills
Love kills, drills you through your heart
Love kills, scars you from the start
It's just a living pastime
Ruining your heartline
Stays for a lifetime won't let you go
Cause love (love) love (love) love won't leave you alone

Kate Bush: Hello Earth
ou The Man with the Child in his Eyes
ou Wuthering Heights
Too long I roam in the night
I'm coming back to his side, to put it right
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window

Electric Light Orchestra: Standin’ in the rain
I'm standing in the rain
Doing my thing
I'm trying my best
What does it bring?
I'm standing in the rain
Getting soaking wet
I'm doing my best
But what do I get?

The Sound of Music
I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I've heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more
